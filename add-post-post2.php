<!-- after talking to brian you learned that all session variables need to be declared after the variable their based on has been created. so in this case $_SESSION['success'] needs to come after $success otherwise you could be sending an empty $_SESSION variable. this was happening on the $errors array. also, had an issue with the header() location. also, realized i need to camelcase all table names from now on or use the weird apostrophe-looking mark to escape the names of my table rows. 
	
	NEXT STEP: SANITIZE THE DATA
	
	now that i've sanitized data i learned a couple of things:
		1. use mysqli_real_escape_string() or prepared statements to sanitize db queries
		2. use strip_slashes(), htmlspecialchars() and htmlentities(); on code that will be output as html
		
		3. if you try to use strip_slashes() et al on db queries it will break the queries
